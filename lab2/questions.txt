6.
a) 	- The most common POS tag is NNP with 6934 occurences.
	- Tagging every word as NNP would result in an accuracy of 20.7%.

b)	- 12.8% of terms in the lexicon are ambiguous (i.e. have >1 POS tag).
	- 50.9% of the total tokens in the text are unambiguous.

8.	- A naiive method which tags each word as the most common POS tag it had
	  in the training set, returns an accuracy of 94.7% on the training data.

9.	- On the test data, the naiive method still performed reasonably well given
	  it's simplicity, returning an accuracy of 88.6%.
