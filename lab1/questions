To compare two files (note -b binary operator changes metric):
> python compare.py -s -b stop_list.txt NEWS/news01.txt NEWS/news02.txt
To compare all files:
> python compare.py -s stop_list.txt NEWS/news??.txt
Adding the '-b' binary option switches to the count-sensitive Jaccard
metric, otherwise, a count-insensitive version will be used.

After running all the files, it appears that the two identical files
are news02.txt and news08.txt as they have a similarity score of 1.

The similarity scores for (news04.txt, news07.txt) and 
(news06.txt, news07.txt) are both around 0.5, so it appears that
news07.txt has been created by plagiarising sections of news04.txt
and news06.txt.

Finally, it appears that news01.txt, news05.txt and news09.txt
all address the same topic as they have similarity scores with 
one another of around 0.2-0.35. These articles in actuality all
address the health of Manchester United player George Best.
